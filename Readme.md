####How to install

- Initiate an environment so that Django server can be run
- It can be done by `virtualenv env_name --python=/<PYTHON_PATH>`
- Run `pip install -r "requirements.txt"`
- Activate the environment using `source /bin/activate`
- Run the server using `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Then Copy the DomiFront to any place you like (I would prefer to server folder so that you can just go localhost/DomiFront)
- Roll!
